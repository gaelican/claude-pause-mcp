# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Guide

## Overview

This project uses the Claude Pause MCP, which provides an interactive dialog system that allows Claude Code to pause and request user input during development tasks.

## The pause_for_input Tool

The `pause_for_input` tool is automatically used by Claude Code when it needs:
- Clarification on ambiguous requirements
- Design decisions between multiple valid approaches
- User preferences for implementation details
- Confirmation before making significant changes

## How It Works

When Claude needs your input, a dialog window will appear with:

1. **Decision Context**: A clear explanation of what Claude needs to know
2. **Options** (optional): Suggested choices you can select
3. **Response Input**: A text field for your answer
4. **Thinking Mode Selection**: Choose how deeply Claude should analyze your response
5. **Visual Output** (when applicable): Diagrams, layouts, or code structures

## Thinking Modes

Select the appropriate thinking mode based on your needs:

- **[Q] Quick**: Fast responses with minimal analysis (best for simple decisions)
- **[N] Normal**: Standard analysis depth (default choice)
- **[D] Deep**: Extended analysis for complex decisions (slower)
- **[U] Ultra**: Maximum depth analysis for critical decisions (slowest)

Your selected mode is remembered between uses.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Enter`: Submit your response
- `Escape`: Cancel the dialog
- `Q`: Switch to Quick thinking mode
- `N`: Switch to Normal thinking mode
- `D`: Switch to Deep thinking mode
- `U`: Switch to Ultra thinking mode
- `1-9`: Quick select numbered options (if provided)
- `P`: Toggle planning mode

## Planning Mode

When enabled, planning mode automatically appends a request for Claude to:
1. Continue planning the implementation
2. Present a complete plan using pause_for_input
3. Wait for approval before making code changes

This ensures you can review and approve implementation strategies before execution.

## Best Practices

### For Clear Communication
- Be specific in your responses
- If unsure, ask Claude to provide more context
- Use the visual output to understand proposed changes

### For Efficient Development
- Use Quick mode for simple yes/no decisions
- Use Deep/Ultra mode for architectural decisions
- Enable planning mode for complex features
- Review the decision context carefully before responding

### Response Examples

**Simple Response:**
```
"Use React hooks"
```

**Detailed Response:**
```
"Use React hooks with Context API. Prioritize performance over simplicity. Include proper TypeScript types."
```

**With Planning Mode:**
```
"Implement using Redux Toolkit. Focus on maintainability."
[Planning mode will add: "Please continue planning..."]
```

## Common Scenarios

### Architecture Decisions
Claude: "Should I use REST API or GraphQL for the backend?"
You: Select an option or provide custom guidance

### Implementation Details
Claude: "How should I structure the component hierarchy?"
You: Describe your preferences or approve Claude's suggestion

### Feature Clarification
Claude: "The requirements mention 'user dashboard' - what should this include?"
You: Provide specific features and requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Dialog Doesn't Appear
- Check if the MCP server is running
- Restart Claude Code if needed
- Verify the MCP is properly installed

### Response Not Accepted
- Ensure you click Submit or press Ctrl+Enter
- Check for any error messages
- Try selecting a different thinking mode

## Configuration

The MCP stores preferences in hidden files:
- `.thinking_mode_preference`: Your default thinking mode
- `.planning_mode_preference`: Planning mode on/off state
- `.electron_window_bounds.json`: Window position and size

## Additional Features

### Visual Output Panel
When Claude needs to show diagrams, layouts, or structured data, it appears in the visual output panel. You can:
- Copy the content
- Expand for better viewing
- Clear when no longer needed

### Multiple Choice + Text Input
You can either:
- Select from provided options
- Enter custom text
- Select an option and modify it

### Response History
The tool maintains a history of recent responses for quick reuse.
