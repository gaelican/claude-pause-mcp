## üöÄ How to Use Sub-Agents

### Basic Usage

To use a sub-agent, invoke the Task tool with the agent name:

```
I need help with WebSocket disconnection issues

Claude: I'll use the MCP Protocol Specialist to help with this.

<Task tool invocation with subagent_type="mcp-protocol-specialist">
```

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Creating a New Dialog Component
```
User: I need to create a multi-step wizard dialog with validation

Claude: I'll use the Dialog Component Engineer sub-agent to help design and implement this.

Task parameters:
- subagent_type: "dialog-component-engineer"
- prompt: "Create a multi-step wizard dialog component with form validation, step navigation, and progress indication"
```

#### Scenario 2: Debugging Performance Issues
```
User: The app is running slowly when multiple dialogs are open

Claude: I'll use the Performance Optimization Analyst to investigate this issue.

Task parameters:
- subagent_type: "performance-optimization-analyst"
- prompt: "Investigate and fix performance issues when multiple dialogs are open simultaneously"
```

#### Scenario 3: Setting Up CI/CD
```
User: We need automated builds for all platforms

Claude: I'll use the Build & Deploy Specialist to set this up.

Task parameters:
- subagent_type: "build-deploy-specialist"  
- prompt: "Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux with code signing"
```

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Agent
- Match the agent's expertise to your specific need
- Consider using multiple agents for complex tasks
- Start with the most specialized agent for your problem

### 2. Provide Clear Context
- Describe the problem in detail
- Include error messages or symptoms
- Specify desired outcomes

### 3. Follow Agent Recommendations
- Each agent has deep expertise in their domain
- Trust their architectural decisions
- Implement their suggested patterns

### 4. Iterate and Refine
- Start with the primary issue

## üîç Agent Implementation Details

Each agent is defined as a Markdown file with:
- **YAML frontmatter**: Metadata including name, description, and tools
- **System prompt**: Detailed expertise and approach
- **Examples**: Common scenarios and solutions
- **Best practices**: Domain-specific guidelines

To add a new sub-agent:
1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Follow the existing format with frontmatter
3. Write a comprehensive system prompt
4. Include relevant examples and patterns
